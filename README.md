# ur5_rg2_moveit2_config

Custom MoveIt 2 configuration for Universal Robot 5 (UR5) robot with OnRobot RG2 gripper. If you have accidentally stumbled upon this repository and you need to control UR with MoveIt 2, you are most probably looking for [UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver) instead.

## Disclaimer

This configuration was tested with [ur5_rg2_ign](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/ur5_rg2_ign) in a simulated Ignition Gazebo environment. If you are working with a real robot, please use the official [Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver).
